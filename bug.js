This bug occurs when using the Expo `Constants.deviceName` API to retrieve the device name on Android.  The API sometimes returns an empty string or null instead of the actual device name, even when the device name is properly configured in the Android system settings. This inconsistency can lead to unexpected behavior in applications that rely on the device name for identification or personalization purposes.
